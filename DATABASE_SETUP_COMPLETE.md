# Database Setup Complete ✅

## Issue Summary

You were experiencing a 500 error when trying to start a conversation:

```
Error: failed with status code 500
at async l (/app/node_modules/@prisma/client/runtime/library.js:130:9633)
```

When trying to access: `GET /api/v1/chat/conversations/{id}/history`

## Root Cause

**The database was completely empty** - the Prisma schema had not been applied to the production PostgreSQL database on Render. When the application tried to query the `messages` table (or any table), Prisma returned an error because no tables existed.

## Resolution

### 1. Applied Database Schema
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

This created all necessary tables in the database:
- `users` - User accounts and preferences
- `messages` - Chat messages and conversations
- `events` - Sports events
- `markets` - Betting markets
- `odds_snapshots` - Historical odds data
- `bets` - User bets
- `sportsbooks` - Sportsbook configurations
- `team_mappings` - Canonical team name mappings
- `documents` & `chunks` - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) data
- `idempotency_keys` - Request deduplication
- `job_logs` - Background job tracking

### 2. Seeded Initial Data
```bash
npx ts-node prisma/seed.ts
```

Populated the database with:
- ✅ 4 sportsbooks (FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM, Caesars)
- ✅ 3 team mappings (Chiefs, Lakers, Yankees)
- ✅ 2 sample events (NFL, NBA)
- ✅ 2 sample documents for RAG

## Current Status

✅ **Database is fully initialized and ready**
✅ **Application compiled successfully**
✅ **Chat endpoints should now work correctly**

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your application** (if it's currently running)
2. **Test the chat functionality** - Create a new conversation and send messages
3. **User accounts will be created automatically** when users first authenticate via Auth0

## Database Connection

Your application is connected to:
- **Host**: `dpg-d3eobgemcj7s73dtvhug-a.oregon-postgres.render.com`
- **Database**: `betthink_postgres`
- **Provider**: PostgreSQL on Render
- **Extensions**: pgvector (for semantic search)

## Authentication Flow

When users authenticate:
1. Auth0 validates the JWT token
2. The `Auth0Strategy` extracts the `sub` (subject) from the token
3. `UsersService.findOrCreate()` creates a user record in the database if it doesn't exist
4. The user's database ID (CUID) is used for all subsequent operations
5. Messages, bets, and other user data are properly associated with the database user ID

## Important Notes

- **User IDs**: The system now properly uses database CUIDs for all foreign key relationships
- **Conversations**: Are tracked by `conversationId` (not stored as a separate table)
- **Messages**: All messages include `userId`, `conversationId`, `role`, and `content`
- **Idempotency**: Duplicate request prevention is built-in for critical endpoints

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any database-related errors:

1. **Check database connection**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db pull
   ```

2. **Verify tables exist**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma studio
   ```

3. **Re-generate Prisma Client**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

4. **View database logs** in your Render dashboard

## Future Database Operations

- **Migrations**: Use `npx prisma migrate dev` for schema changes in development
- **Production Updates**: Use `npx prisma migrate deploy` for production
- **Backup**: Regular backups are handled by Render
- **Monitoring**: Check Render dashboard for connection pool and query performance
